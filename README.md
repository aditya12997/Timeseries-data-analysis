# Timeseries-data-analysis

In this project I have studied how TimeSeries data can be manipulated according to the time order we want to see. 

I have taken different companies data from yahoo finance where I have analysed the closing stock prices of the Data of these comapanies and the ROI they generate and to also see which companies have the highest ROI in the last 365 days and 100 days and we can evaluate the performances of this company in a granular way and from a birds eye view as well. 

Below one can see as how the stock performnaces of top tech giants are flowing throughtout a set period of time, and AMAZON has been leading the race with a highest stock price and a even greater Return on Investment % as per our figure.

For more granularity, I saw also plotted to see how close were these companies competing for the last 100 days as well, and whether or not there is a significant difference in the performance of these Tech Giants.

Yes, we see the difference that in the last quarter all the companies were positioned well although Amazon is still leading with highest price but we see that the difference when we change the TimeFrame.


## Using MPLFINANCE is another way to plot out Timeseries data where we can compare the price of the share with Volume and also visualise the Moving Average.
## Lets first look at Amazon since it's been performing good.

### In this plot we are looking if there was any dip in the performance of the share price of these Tech Giants BEFORE and After COVID-19.

For Amazon as we see there is a dip we see when the whole world was facing the consequences of COVID and the performance was low due the uncertainty.


## Let's look at GOOGLE as well, was it only AMAZON? If not, how deeply was google affected as well?

Here's a plot for us to visualize -

We can spot the post COVID-19 effect that GOOGLE was not able to quickly recover from the situation like AMAZON and YES, it did affect GOOGLE's performance as well.
