# Timeseries-data-analysis

In this project I have studied how TimeSeries data can be manipulated according to the time order we want to see. 

I have taken different companies data from yahoo finance where I have analysed the closing stock prices of the Data of these comapanies and the ROI they generate and to also see which companies have the highest ROI in the last 365 days and 100 days and we can evaluate the performances of this company in a granular way and from a birds eye view as well.
